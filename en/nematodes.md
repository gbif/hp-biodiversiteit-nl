### Around 1.100 species of nematodes are present in the Dutch soil
There is limited understanding of the state of this group of small roundworms, because research into nematodes has so far been patchy. However, there does seem to be an advance of problematic species from southern Europe due to climate change. A small proportion of nematode species can cause serious economic damage to agricultural and horticultural crops. There are strict EU policies on this, imple-mented by the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority.
In addition to the nematodes that live freely in the soil, there is a small group that occurs as parasites in humans or animals. Some specific species are widely cultivated and used commercially for biolog-ical control of insect larvae. Furthermore, a number of tropical species in Dutch greenhouses feature among the exotics.
Through their activities, nematodes affect other organisms and processes in the soil. As a result, they play a pivotal role in the functioning of soil food webs. They are involved in the conversion of organic matter into nutrients and influence the growth and biomass of their food sources, such as bacteria and fungi. In this way, they contribute to healthy ecosystems by enhancing soil biodiversity and the natural capacity to suppress diseases and pests.
